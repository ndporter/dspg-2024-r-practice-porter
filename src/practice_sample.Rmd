## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Installing and Loading Packages

One of the first things to do is ensure you have the packages (also
called libraries) you need. Packages contain additional functions and
data that enhance the functionality of R.

Let's try loading a package and making it so R can use it.

```{r load-tidy}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you have the `tidyverse` package installed, you should see
information about what was loaded. Tidyverse is actually a collection of
packages that are frequently used together, so it may show as loading
moultiple packages.

If you see an error instead, you probably don't have the package
installed. To install a package, either use the `Install` button on the
`Packages` tab in RStudio *or* install it from the `Console` like this:

```         
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you open an R script (`.R`), R Markdown (`.Rmd`) or Quarto file that
loads a package you don't have installed with `library()`, RStudio will
display a warning at the top of the script window that asks if you want
to install it now.

Occasionally, you may need a package that's not in CRAN (the main R
archive). That package's homepage (often on Git) should provide code and
directions to install it (though make sure you trust it before
installing).
